# Project Status Definition

### Idea

Expect no working code.

### Prototype

Have some working code, but expect:

- less than optimal documentation
- API breaking at any time

### Feature Complete

All desired major features have been completed. Active maintenance will be limited to the following cases:

- when an upstream or a dependency released a breaking change
- when a security issue raises

You are still welcomed to propose new features or bugfixes.

### Works on My Machine

This project consists of some simple programs or scripts that is meant to provide ideas to others, not to be directly used.

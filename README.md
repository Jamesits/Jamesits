# Personal Status

![Fun fact #0: here is a picture that you disabled people will not be able to see because everyone is putting images in their personal readme and nobody cares about accessibility.](https://github.com/Jamesits/Jamesits/raw/master/assets/meme_side_project.jpg)

# Notes to Everyone

Fun fact #1: When GitHub decided to use `https://github.com/<username>/<username>` to display this user-level readme, they completely forgot the existance of `https://github.com/<username>/.github` which [has been here for years](https://docs.github.com/en/github/building-a-strong-community/creating-a-default-community-health-file).

Fun fact #2: Another fun fact for you: relative URLs don't work in your profile page.
